00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,310
Hello, everyone. Welcome back. I'm going to be going into the skills exercise

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:09,930
for build applications with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,590
this is part of our GitHub Skills course catalog.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,390
it is a self-service. all of the skills are self-service,

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,470
so any, any person can come into this,

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,190
organization and any of these repositories.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,880
And run through these skills in their own,

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,120
user name or organization that they have within GitHub as well.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,300
So I'm going to get started with kind of just a general read me

10
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,880
of this, as you can see here,

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,940
you know, we have a little welcome that walks through,

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,680
you know, about GitHub Copilot and what it can accomplish,

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,520
who this course is for, you know,

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,530
intermediate developers. What you learn,

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,370
what you'll build, any prerequisites,

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,570
and how long this should take about an hour.

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,670
And, that includes time for dealing with agent mode and

18
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:08,910
thinking and coming back into the conversation.

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,330
Both GitHub, Copilot Chat and Agent Mode in general are

20
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,690
very conversational. Obviously,

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,510
Agent Mode is able to make some assumptions based on context and walk through

22
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,550
things as well, but I'll get into that.

23
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,770
and then basically at this point, if you wanted to run this,

24
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,710
you could, right click. And then say open a new tab and then this

25
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:38,510
would allow you to create the repository under your username or organization

26
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:41,990
of your choice, and give it a description and then you can then start,

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,090
developing that.

28
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,330
the idea is that when you take this into your own repository,

29
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:48,650
once,

30
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,850
an action runs and it gets set up, This,

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,010
copy exercise would become gray, and then you would start the exercise,

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,970
and that's kind of what some of this dialogue here talks about,

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,610
so you can read through that as well.

34
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,190
and then,

35
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,210
we get into,

36
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,250
kind of the, the story,

37
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,570
this is just kind of showing a practical example of a fictitious,

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,190
high school called Mergenton High School, and

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,410
the Octofit Tracker Application Story.

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,300
four Mergington High School, where Paul Octo is,

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,840
has been a physical education teacher at Mergington High School for about eight years.

42
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,700
and despite his enthusiasm,

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,860
and creative approach to gym class, he's been increasingly concerned about his students,

44
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,300
you know,

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,140
that their physical activity is declined and many students admitted they're really actually,

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,860
exercise outside of PE class.

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,850
so really the objectives here for Paul is to make a fitness tracking app

48
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:53,610
fun and engaging, create positive peer pressure through friendly competition,

49
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,170
allow him to monitor student progress remotely,

50
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,390
and provide personalized guidance based on individual fitness levels.

51
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,670
and then this is where the birth of this app comes from,

52
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,470
and this just talks about the different user experience goals,

53
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,910
technical specifications,

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,340
and the current development status of where things are at,

55
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,560
and the next steps for Paul are with this basic infrastructure in place.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,640
Paul's now focused on these items to start developing,

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,800
and then this workshop. You, the end user,

58
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:32,440
will set up a development environment using GitHub code spaces.

59
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,660
So, GitHub code spaces will have a full environment with a,

60
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,280
BS code IDE, as well as the ability to install packages and services,

61
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,800
and,

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
run, run them,

63
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,120
off of different ports as well, which we'll do as part of this app.

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,200
and then we'll use GitHub Copa,

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Copa to accelerate the development across multiple technologies.

66
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,950
building key components for the OctoFit tracker app.

67
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,290
this was include,

68
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,270
user profiles, activity logging, tracking.

69
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,770
this talks just about the different models that are available.

70
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,530
so people can dig into that. And then we have some prompt engineering links

71
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:12,990
of how to do different techniques for prompt engineering,

72
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:15,290
as well as a link about agent mode,

73
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,670
the agent awakens blog,

74
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,310
that you can also,

75
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,450
if we were to bring this up here, they can read through this blog

76
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:22,030
directly,

77
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,810
about what, what that is. I'll close that now.

78
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,590
And then this talks about the React front end,

79
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,750
Python, Django back end, and a database MongoDB that we'll be using as part

80
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:36,710
of creating this app,

81
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,050
and some of the prerequisites.

82
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,170
the other thing that's, that's interesting, too,

83
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,010
is that,

84
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,710
trying to see the part about,

85
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,550
the other part I wanted to point out is that Paul is,

86
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,410
actively,

87
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,730
collaborating with the IT department and Jessica Cat,

88
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,270
is has been particularly impressed and pleased with OctoFit tracker

89
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:05,310
maintains the compliance with all the requirements specified.

90
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,870
And we have this file, this,

91
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,510
docs,

92
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,750
mergington,

93
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,150
techpolices.md that really Is a list of instructions

94
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:18,110
and guidance, forget of copilot agent mode,

95
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,590
as well as, if it was a human being, but in this case,

96
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,930
it's agent mode that's going through that dock and taking that,

97
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,830
to create the entire app for us.

98
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,970
We're just prompting it with different,

99
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,000
We're just giving you different prompts to guide through step-by-step to build this app

100
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,040
from the backend, the ground up,

101
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,920
the structure, all the way through, and we'll get into that now.

102
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,440
I also wanted to show to,

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,380
let's go to the pre,

104
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,600
the preparing. So, one of the things here in the preparing is that,

105
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,620
this is, you know, talks about the code space,

106
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,190
And this is where you would now,

107
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,950
right click and then open up this into a new,

108
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,210
and create a code space there. I happen to have mine up here.

109
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,490
So again, you have the same,

110
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,290
it's all the repositories checked out.

111
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,750
It's a fully functional development environment,

112
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,110
with VS code,

113
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,370
because this app is using multiple ports. I've opened those ports up and that's

114
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:20,370
already built in as part of the code space.

115
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,170
and this again is the read me for the story.

116
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,910
and then if I was going to then start this,

117
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,510
exercise I'd come back here,

118
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,630
my code space has been created. And at that point,

119
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,350
I've started to walk through,

120
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,910
you know, building this app. This just talks about also your repository in your,

121
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:41,550
in your,

122
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,750
you know, the full repo name that you've created that you've cloned this template

123
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,430
from. And,

124
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,050
you can create a branch, for example,

125
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,310
I get up copilot application,

126
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,130
and you can do things like that,

127
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,050
as well as part of this, but,

128
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,790
right now we'll dive into,

129
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,590
the bill, this is really the meat of it. So we have about,

130
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,250
really five or four main steps.

131
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:07,210
The first one's just a preparation. This gets into,

132
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,550
the application set up the directory structure,

133
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,210
the Python requirements, the Django project app,

134
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,210
and MongoDB,

135
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,100
So by just giving it this prompt,

136
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,600
we can start this process, and I'll kind of show an example of that.

137
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,020
So what they usually would do is they would, you know,

138
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,420
obviously in their code space, they could open up,

139
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,620
all of the same files.

140
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,580
I'm going to, we're going to ask them to open up this file as

141
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,460
well as our,

142
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,280
our story and our tech specs for Mergington High School.

143
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,760
and we're going to keep those open. I'll probably move this over here just

144
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:45,180
so it's the primary thing.

145
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,920
and now this is our co-pilot chat window where we're going to hit co-pilot

146
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:53,280
edits. And here we're going to select agent.

147
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,840
We're going to stay with the GPT4O model.

148
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,580
and

149
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,340
let me just move,

150
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,020
my video out of my video over here.

151
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
So I'm out of the way a bit.

152
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,120
and then you can see what's going on here a little bit better.

153
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,230
so then we would take this first prompt here,

154
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,190
we'll open this up, we'll, we'll copy this,

155
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,870
and we're going to do is we're going to say add context.

156
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,530
This pop-up will happen. It'll happen a couple times and you just click allow,

157
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,830
and we're going to say open editor. So then what that means is everything

158
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:30,510
that's open right now and our editor up here is what the context that

159
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,390
GitHub co-pilot.

160
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,710
agent mode is going to use,

161
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,370
for, for this effort. And then I'm going to paste this and we're going

162
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:37,930
to see what,

163
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,690
the magic that agent mode already has as part of it.

164
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,890
it's going to go through now. And it's going to read.

165
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,650
It's going to say, oh, you need to make this directory to create the

166
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:48,090
structure.

167
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,930
so it's going to open up a new terminal window to do that.

168
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,010
it's going to then say, okay, I need this requirements.

169
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,510
And it's going to touch this file to create the file.

170
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,090
And as you can see on the left side here, we're starting to create

171
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:06,290
the application. And here it's already created our requirements for the Python packages

172
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,710
that need to be installed. I'm going to keep that file because I want

173
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,850
to save it. We'll end up checking all these in as a user.

174
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:16,110
They'll also be checking these in. And then we can continue.

175
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,910
again, one of those allow block windows will open up and just hit allow.

176
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,920
and that's really the first,

177
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,340
prompt. Obviously I'm, I'm looking, I'm not looking at this in the nice pretty

178
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,360
markdown. This is the raw markdown file,

179
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,700
but

180
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,220
same, same thing that they would see,

181
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,380
the nice pretty version, or they can look at this too either way.

182
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,620
So at this point, we've now installed all of the Python packages that we

183
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:55,080
need for the back end to start to develop our app.

184
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,080
It is telling us like, do we want to set up the project?

185
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,200
We could say yes there,

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,600
I've designed this so that we are really kind of doing this step by

187
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:06,440
step to show the end user,

188
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,020
what they're building. So then we would copy this prompt and then we would

189
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:14,140
say, okay, now I'll create the,

190
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,060
the back end,

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,380
set up any additional configuration for the Django project app.

192
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,400
And we'll do that here. Now we created the app.

193
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,180
We are also going to do,

194
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,940
something that with,

195
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,440
Django, it does this, has this manager,

196
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,940
Python script that allows for,

197
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,180
making migrations and then, and migrating so we should see something that checks everything

198
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,220
out for us and everything looks good.

199
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,780
And at this point, we're very happy and we could actually run the server

200
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:46,720
if we wanted to. And just like that,

201
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,240
we have already the Django server up and running.

202
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,730
In our environment that is set to go obviously nothing's been set up for

203
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,590
our specific app, but the Django,

204
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,490
stack has been set up for us.

205
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,490
I'm going to close that, come back here,

206
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,790
and then we can go to,

207
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,210
installing. I'm not going to walk through every single step here,

208
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,330
but you get the idea at this point, we would install the database,

209
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,550
and we would do those things. So,

210
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,350
if you were to hop around to number three,

211
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,230
For example, then what we would do is start creating,

212
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,570
filling in the Django project of all of the files we need for URLs,

213
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,490
views, model serializers, settings,

214
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,290
and the admin files, any tests as well,

215
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,970
and then we would,

216
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,070
prompt to create the database structure,

217
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,270
the MongoDB database structure here with this prompt and this activity.

218
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,040
Then we would edit the,

219
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,080
Octofit tracker,

220
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,180
Django files here for each one of those,

221
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,220
that we already talked about in the last activity.

222
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,440
And then this last step here is last activity in this step is to

223
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:56,980
actually populate the database with some test data that we get,

224
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,880
you know, made up,

225
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,400
and then we're going to create this Python populate DB script that will automatically,

226
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,780
populate that database for us. And then once that's done,

227
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,080
Then what we can do is we can really,

228
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,740
set up the rest API framework,

229
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,400
for with, with the, with the Django,

230
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,020
rest framework.

231
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,940
when it comes set up initially, it's going to have local host as URL

232
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:22,240
and that really is not going to do anything for us.

233
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,700
So what these steps do is it actually helps replace with our code space.

234
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:27,980
So if I was to go,

235
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,940
back to my code space, this would be the name that I would replace.

236
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,840
in that step here at the top, you can see that,

237
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,340
and

238
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,900
sorry, go, yep.

239
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,520
we would replace that with our specific name so we would kind of take

240
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:47,000
from the bracket here and put the,

241
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,080
the name of our code space and then that would automatically replace

242
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,560
in the URLs and views, everything that's necessary so that then we have the

243
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:58,220
right end points and then,

244
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,280
we could get all of the information out of the database from that point

245
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,700
on. The last piece of this right now,

246
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,360
is to set up the front end,

247
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,780
react framework,

248
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,240
so that's what, oops,

249
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,830
in the wrong one. It would set up the React framework,

250
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,690
so we would, we would set up these different,

251
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,570
components as well as update the app and indexes of the React framework.

252
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,210
and with this we would have activities, the leaderboard team users and,

253
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:30,230
and workout, and that should also get the information back from what's in the

254
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:30,990
database today.

255
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,890
and these was just some other things, other, other activities of updating that front

256
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:40,010
end components and then to verify them and check the output at the very

257
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:40,430
end.

258
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,940
I plan to also add one more step,

259
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,400
maybe for generating some tests so people can see that as well to test

260
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:47,920
the app.

261
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,020
but overall this is pretty complete that we could create a full stack app

262
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:54,160
at this point if we wanted to.

263
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,430
so I hope this was informative.

264
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,610
I may do follow up videos as we kind of finalize the skill.

265
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,150
It's still kind of in a draft form,

266
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:06,290
but most of the details and it working is there.

267
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,890
I just wanted to,

268
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,050
get it out there before it's finalized and we're all complete.

269
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,710
just because there's some other iterations I'd like to do on peer reviews and

270
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:16,050
having,

271
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,750
having some of the documentation may be updated,

272
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:21,530
as well. We can use Copilot as a peer reviewer.

273
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:24,210
Or so I also might run it through co-pilot to review it before we

274
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,070
check everything in,

275
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,650
and finalize it. But

276
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,670
thank you for the time. I hope this was useful, and we'll see you

277
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:30,050
again soon.
