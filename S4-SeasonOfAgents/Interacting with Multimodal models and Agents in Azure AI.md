# Session Details

## Session Title: 
[Interacting with Multimodal models and Agents in Azure AI Foundry](https://github.com/microsoft/aitour-interact-with-llms) 


## Session Abstract:
Innovate with Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o multimodal model in this hands-on experience in Azure AI Foundry. Learn the core concepts and best practices to effectively generate with text, sound, and images using GPT-4o-mini, DALL-E and GPT-4o-realtime. Create AI Agents that enhance user experiences and drive innovation.

## Level: 
100

## Goal of the session: 
* Demistify multimodal models, how they function and their capabilities
* Provide hands-on experience with Azure AI Foundry Portal to build LLMs-based applications

## Duration: 
75 minutes

## Speaker Expectation/Skills:
Speakers should be familar with LLMs and prompt engineering, as well as Azure AI Foundry Portal. 
The session is designed as a 75 minutes lab, where the attendees walk through the step by step workshop manual supervised by the main speaker and one or more proctors. The speaker is expected to introduce each section of the lab with few slides and then reserve the rest of the time for the practice. 
If the event logistics do not allow to deliver this as a lab, the speaker can go through each lab section and demonstrate it as a bunch of hands-on demos. 

## Session overview: 
The session will cover the following topics:
- Text generation with basic and advanced prompting
- Image generation 
- Multimodal interfaces with real-time audio interactions
- Azure AI Agents 

## Key Audience Takeaways:
By the end of this session, participants will gain hands-on experience in Azure AI Foundry Portal, by interacting with multimodal models using several prompting techniques and building an agentic AI prototype.

## Session Key technologies:
- Azure OpenAI Service
- Azure AI Foundry Portal
- Azure AI Agent Service
