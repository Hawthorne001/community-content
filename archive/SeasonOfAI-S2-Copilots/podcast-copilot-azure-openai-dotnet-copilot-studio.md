# Podcast Copilot with Azure OpenAI Service, .NET, and Copilot Studio

These instructions are designed for community leaders and presenters who wish to pick up this Azure OpenAI Service, .NET, and Copilot Studio session and re-deliver it at community events. Below, you’ll find all the necessary assets and relevant instructions for each stage of the presentation.

## Session Details

**Session Title:** Podcast Copilot with Azure OpenAI Service, .NET, and Copilot Studio

**Session Abstract:** Let’s explore the integration of Azure OpenAI Service advanced AI models with .NET and Copilot Studio by creating a dynamic custom copilot that takes in a podcast URL and quickly generates a social media image and post promoting the latest episode of that podcast.

In this session, we’ll be accomplishing this by:

- Introducing the Azure OpenAI Service, describing the models and creating AI deployments
- Creating a .NET API using the .NET Azure OpenAI SDK and creating a Custom Connector from Visual Studio
- Building a custom copilot with Copilot Studio that leverages the Azure OpenAI Service through the .NET API

Sounds good? Then why don’t you join me in discovering that building intelligent copilots has never been easier with the Microsoft Cloud + AI.

**Level:** 200

**Goal of the session:** To introduce the Azure OpenAI Service and Copilot Studio to an audience and demonstrate how to use these tools with .NET to build a custom copilot.

**Duration:** 45 to 60 mins session content (with time for Q&A)

**Speaker Expectation/Skills:** Mid-level theory content, multiple complex demos, hands on experience with Azure OpenAI Service, .NET APIs, Power Automate, and Copilot Studio.
