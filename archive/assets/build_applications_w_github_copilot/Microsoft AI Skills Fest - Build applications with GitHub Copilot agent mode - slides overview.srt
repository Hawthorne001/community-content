00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:04,385
Hi, my name is Ari LiVigni. Welcome to Microsoft AI SkillsFest,

2
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:09,521
and this is the specific, train-the-trainer for build applications

3
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:13,821
with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode. we'll do a title slide here,

4
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:17,076
a brief introduction of myself, and my credentials,

5
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:19,355
and what team I'm with, and some of my hobbies,

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,265
and things that I do outside of work time.

7
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:27,797
and then we'll tag folks about the Guinness Book of World Records,

8
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:28,807
the QR code, and how they can also,

9
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:32,091
interact with our live moderators in chat as well.

10
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:33,274
the agenda for this,

11
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:37,427
is about five points. We'll do an introduction of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode,

12
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:39,655
the learning objectives that users will achieve,

13
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,750
in this skills course. Explore the power of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

14
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,758
some of the background on the skill and kind of the setting of it,

15
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:47,567
and,

16
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,712
what we'll be covering. And then we'll get right into,

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,629
building an application directly,

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,381
with Agent Mode, and we're going to call it OctoFit Tracker.

19
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:59,042
the slides. Here's the brief introduction.

20
00:00:59,043 --> 00:00:59,463
So,

21
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:04,005
you know, this is really about experiencing the next evolution of AI-assisted coding

22
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:08,733
with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous peer programmer capable of performing

23
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:11,177
multi-step coding tasks as you, as,

24
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:15,527
as your command, at your command. It analyzes your code base,

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,246
reads relevant files, proposes file edits,

26
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:20,883
and runs termination. and tests,

27
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:24,310
Agent Mode iterates on its own code. So if it finds an error in

28
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,160
some of the code it's written or a command,

29
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:29,263
it recognizes those errors and then will fix them automatically.

30
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,856
it is available as a preview as of now,

31
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,803
as of March 17th.

32
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:36,585
and it's in the VS Code Insiders for users currently.

33
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:42,196
the learning objectives will be understanding how to develop with the VS Code IDE

34
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:43,630
in a GitHub code space,

35
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:45,173
prompt,

36
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,546
GitHub Copilot Agent Mode to create an application,

37
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:48,909
leverage,

38
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,020
internal, or I should say, leverage documentation files that are in the repository,

39
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,836
in the GitHub repository to instruct GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

40
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:57,694
And GitHub Copilot Agent Mode iterates over the code base,

41
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:00,104
Thank That's in the repository, it'll fix errors,

42
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,340
refactor code, and also help develop new features.

43
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:06,853
kind of the key points in exploring GitHub Copilot Agent Mode is,

44
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:09,386
is its features of autonomous operation.

45
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:13,917
Copilot Agent Mode operates in a more autonomous and dynamic manner to achieve the

46
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:18,134
desired outcome. It determines the relevant context and files to execute.

47
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:21,285
It can edit autonomously without explicit user specification.

48
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:24,478
multi-step tasks, it can perform multi-step coding tasks,

49
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:29,687
such as creating apps from scratch, performing refactorings across multiple files,

50
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,030
and writing and running tests.

51
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:34,751
we'll be running through all of this during the exercise in the skills course.

52
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:38,690
tools for task completion. Agent Mode uses a set of tools to perform specific

53
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:42,750
tasks. Like editing files and running terminal commands.

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,502
These tools can run in parallel. Examples include listing files,

55
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:50,808
reading file contents, running terminal commands,

56
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:52,258
and getting terminal output.

57
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,976
code changes and terminal commands, Compilot will suggest both code changes and terminal

58
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:01,460
commands to complete the task. It might compile a code instead of install packages.

59
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:02,739
And run tests,

60
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,750
iteration and self-healing, as I talked about earlier.

61
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:09,562
Agent mode iterates independently to achieve the desired outcome,

62
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:11,753
fixing issues as they come up.

63
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:16,669
It monitors the correctness of code edits and terminal command

64
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,909
output and iterates to remediate issues.

65
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:23,370
It can detect issues and problems in code edits.

66
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:26,695
And terminal commands and perform additional actions to resolve them.

67
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:31,569
It, it also analyzes runtime errors with self-healing capabilities.

68
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,536
it is user control and review. You can keep files or dispose of them.

69
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:37,786
and it will request confirmation or ask questions.

70
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:41,848
So it's very conversational back and forth as is co-pilot chat originally.

71
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,812
and you can also modify proposed terms. Terminal commands before running them,

72
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,962
context management, while autonomous.

73
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:51,796
You can still explicitly reference context with the pound file using

74
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,459
drag and drop of certain files.

75
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,749
you can also use code,

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,223
the hash code bit code base. It's a chat,

77
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:57,617
a chat,

78
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:58,214
variable,

79
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:01,653
in your prompt to let co-pilot find the right files automatically.

80
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:04,547
I'll see you So, requires enabling,

81
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:08,175
the GitHub co-pilot chat code search enabled preview in the preview setting.

82
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:10,230
You can undo and redo,

83
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,478
you can interrupt requests,

84
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,858
and there are the limitations we'll review also as agent mode is currently in

85
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,251
a preview and available in VS Code or VS Code Insiders.

86
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,695
So, it has not G, G8 yet,

87
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:21,607
and there definitely is,

88
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:23,622
it's, it's experimental, and we're you.

89
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:27,119
Using that to collect feedback from users and early adopters.

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,659
It might take longer to get a response due to multiple steps.

91
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,783
It can be more non-deterministic than edit mode.

92
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:38,452
It may also quickly you, use up your free co-pilot quota as it,

93
00:04:38,463 --> 00:04:43,005
sends multiple requests per prompt. Agent mode is not available for working with notebooks,

94
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:43,858
in VS Code.

95
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:44,860
and then we will,

96
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:48,232
at that point, go to the next slide.

97
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:51,358
So this kind of talks about more of the skill background,

98
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:55,777
and in the next video, I'll get into really walking through the skill,

99
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:58,262
the skill course that we have in github.com,

100
00:04:58,263 --> 00:04:59,104
and it's part of our,

101
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:03,170
our skill course catalog. But the background on this skill is that we're,

102
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:05,981
we're developing a fictitious app,

103
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,506
at Mergington High School.

104
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,694
the characters are Paul Octo, who is a gym teacher,

105
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:11,707
and is,

106
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,202
working with someone in IT, Jessica Cat,

107
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:15,662
to create a,

108
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:17,038
an app to keep,

109
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:21,666
students more active. So students rarely exercise outside of the required PE class.

110
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:22,667
So,

111
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:26,782
we needed, he needed an app to create an email.

112
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:29,261
to create,

113
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,592
activities to be more fun and engaging, to keep,

114
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:33,045
students on track for their fitness goals.

115
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:36,318
the solution, therefore, is developing this OctoFit Tracker app,

116
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,087
a social fitness tracking application built with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode,

117
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:44,842
and it's compliant with the school policy. So, this Mergington Tech Dollars,

118
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:46,276
Tech Policies,

119
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:50,412
Markdown 5, is what's used to really generate a lot of,

120
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:54,741
what Copilot Agent Mode uses to create its code,

121
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:59,270
and its terminal commands, and give us direction on continuously developing

122
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:00,008
the,

123
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,474
backend, the database, and the frontend React,

124
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:04,434
frontend of the app.

125
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:07,473
the key features is that we'll have user profiles and activity logs,

126
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:09,685
team competitions,

127
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:10,746
and a leaderboard,

128
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:11,461
personalized,

129
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,644
workout suggestions,

130
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:14,563
progress tracking dashboard,

131
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,813
and so your task as the,

132
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:21,577
as, as the person taking this course and being part of our SkillsFest challenge

133
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:24,840
is to follow Paul's journey using GitHub Codespaces,

134
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:27,273
learn to leverage GitHub Copilot Agent Mode,

135
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:30,418
and build a similar application with the help of GitHub,

136
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:35,077
GitHub Copilot Agent Mode. And that kind of summarizes,

137
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:39,510
that. And then this is a link to the repository that we'll have,

138
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,284
and they can QR code scan this, or they can go to the short

139
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:43,681
link to build the app,

140
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:46,826
and as, sorry, get to the skills course and start developing it in their

141
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:47,210
own,

142
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,938
workspace.

143
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,249
then we'll have just a congratulations. This is all standard as part of the

144
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,472
whole Skills Fest and the Day Zero,

145
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:55,048
Guinness Book,

146
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:58,022
slides. So we're just putting this in our slide deck as well.

147
00:06:58,023 --> 00:07:00,283
and thank you for attending. And that's the end of the deck.

148
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,490
So I'm going to stop the video there,

149
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,644
and then we'll dive into the next video,

150
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:06,701
the actual skills course that we're going to use.
