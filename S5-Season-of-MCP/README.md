# Season 5 - Season of MCP

## Oct 2025 to Jan 2026

This folder contains prepared "content-in-a-box" that anyone can use to do a technical talk as part of the "Season of MCP" (Model Context Provider) at a user group, meetup, or community event. At the end of the "season", the content in this repo will be archived, and a new season of content will be published.

Each topic includes slides and presentation notes. Some will include pre-recorded demos and videos to help you prepare and/or present. Demo code will be available in separate repos linked from each presentation.
