## 📋 Event Organization Checklist

To assist you in organizing your event, we've created a practical checklist covering the key aspects to consider when planning. This guide is designed to help you run a successful technical event, ensuring nothing important is overlooked.

### 👥 1. Initial Planning

- [ ] Connect with other user group leaders in your community to assist with event organization and support. This includes roles such as check-in, main host, timekeeping, and content delivery (speakers, facilitators, etc.).
- [ ] Establish the **date and time** for the event (including 15 extra minutes at the start for adjustments).

### 🏢 2. Initial Planning: Venue and Logistics (in-person events) 

- [ ] Find an **appropriate venue** (Connect with your network to find a company, co-working or university to host the event). As the event is hands-on, ensure the venue has enough space for participants to work comfortably.
- [ ] Verify the **venue capacity** (our recommendation is to have at least 30 participants).
- [ ] Check the **infrastructure** (tables, chairs, stable Wi-Fi, projector or large display, microphone for larger spaces).
- [ ] Confirm the **ease of access** (public transportation, parking). This information is **important for participants** and you should include it in your registration page.
- [ ] You are open to find sponsorship to offer **food and drinks** (water, coffee, snacks).

> [!TIP]
> You can include the logos of space, food, and swag partners on the registration page and event promotional materials. This highlights sponsors and partners, and helps strengthen future collaborations.

### 🎤 3. Content: Speakers & Facilitators

- [ ] Identify and invite speaker/s to lead the presentation.
- [ ] Share the content resources with all speakers and facilitators so they are well-prepared.
- [ ] Prepare a **backup plan** in case a speaker or facilitator is unable to attend.

### 📣 4. Marketing

Your event name should follow this format: `Season of AI - MCP'. 

This makes it easy to identify your event as part of our global initiative.

- [ ] Check with your venue which information they need to allow access and include this information in your registration form (i.e. name, email, experience level with GitHub, etc).
- [ ] **Use our templates to create banners for your event page and social media (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.).** You can find all [available templates in the marketing folder](https://aka.ms/soai/mcp/marketingkit).

**It’s important that your registration page includes the event description, content agenda, date, time, location, banner, and event name for Season of AI - MCP. This ensures consistency and helps participants easily find all the necessary information.**

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend including an event **code of conduct.** This helps create a welcoming and respectful environment for all participants, ensuring that everyone feels comfortable and valued during the event. You can visit the [Azure Tech Groups Code of Conduct](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-tech-groups/code-of-conduct) and the [GitHub Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct)

### 📧 5. Communications

- [ ] Send **reminders** and **prerequisites** to registered participants.
- [ ] Confirm the **attendance** of registered participants a few days before the event.
